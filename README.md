# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `Summery`

The aim of this project to suggest cool domain names to customer.
As customer start type the keyword then request send to the api. which will generate the cool name suggestion for the domain.
Also implemented a interative UI with flex box styling.

Here I've covered basic fundamentals of React & npm modules.
cover basic understanding of class & function component, state management, props & life cycle of component etc.

Looking forward to enhance this project by implementating the wishlist of domain names with backend technology Node JS.
